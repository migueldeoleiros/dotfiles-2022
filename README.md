This repository was made for me to more easily manage my dotfiles and
configuration for my linux system, but you are more than welcome to take
them as a reference or use them yourself. This are not all the dotfiles
on my machine, only the ones that I personaly modified.

# My Program Configs

## My configs for different shells 
(aliases are separeted on [.alias](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/blob/master/.alias))
* [zsh shell](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/blob/master/.zshrc) (My shell of choice )
* [bash shell](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/blob/master/.bashrc)
* [fish shell](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/fish)
* [Oh My Fish!](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/omf)
        
## Keyboard setup
For my keyboard I'm using both sxhkd and kmonad, althow I'm planing on moving all to kmonad
* [sxhkd](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/sxhkd) (for keyboard shortcuts)
* [kmonad](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/kmonad) (for keyboard layout and spanish accents )
* [Xmodmap](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/blob/master/.Xmodmap) (I used this for hjkl as arrow keys, but I now archieve that with kmonad)
        
## Terminal emulator
Kitty is my terminal emulator at the moment, but I also have a copy of alacritty with a similar set up
* [kitty](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/kitty) 
* [alacritty](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/alacritty)
        
## Browser
I use both qutebrowser and librewolf for my browser, using firefox userChrome to make is look similar and less bloated
* [qutebrowser](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/qutebrowser)
* [librewolf](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.librewolf/pzk2etkd.default-release/chrome) (It's fully compatible with Firefox)

## Text editor
I am currently using emacs because of the better IDE features like code completion, but both of this configs are usable and have a lot of the same features
* [neovim](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/nvim) 
* [emacs](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.emacs.d) (check out [System Crafter](https://systemcrafters.cc/))
        
## Other apps
* [tmux](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/tmux) (terminal multiplexer configured with vim-like bindings for my sanity )
* [i3 window manager](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/i3) (My window manager of choice)
* [ranger file-manager](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/ranger) (Best terminal file manager out there)
* [rofi](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/rofi) (I use for both my scipts and as an app launcher)
* [dunst](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/dunst) (Notification daemon without bloat)
* [picom](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/picom.conf) (Currently using [jonaburg's](https://github.com/jonaburg/picom) fork of picom for round corners, animations and blur)
* [polybar](https://github.com/migueldeoleiros/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/polybar) (This is supposed to be used with emacs as a window manager (not my current set up))
